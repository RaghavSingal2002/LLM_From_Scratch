# LLM_From_Scratch
Dialog-Optimized Large Language Model (LLM)
This project is an implementation of a dialog-optimized Large Language Model (LLM) built from the ground up using PyTorch. The primary goal is to create a specialized conversational AI capable of understanding and following personalized, instruction-based interactions with high precision.

Key Features
Built from Scratch: The entire model was engineered from its fundamental components, leveraging the core principles of the Transformer architecture.

Massive Data Processing: Features a robust data processing pipeline built with Tiktoken to efficiently handle and tokenize a large-scale dataset of over 40 million tokens.

Instruction Fine-Tuning: The model is specifically fine-tuned using Instruction Tuning techniques, which significantly enhances its ability to follow precise dialog commands and user instructions.

API for Interaction: Includes a simple API built with Flask/FastAPI, allowing for easy interaction and integration with the trained model.

Tech Stack
Language: Python

Core ML/DL: PyTorch, NumPy

GPU Acceleration: CUDA

Data Processing & Tokenization: Tiktoken

API & Web: Flask, FastAPI

Data Visualization: Matplotlib

Architecture Overview
The model is based on the powerful Transformer Architecture, first introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need". It utilizes the self-attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different words in the input text, allowing it to capture complex contextual relationships and generate coherent, relevant responses for conversational tasks.
