Dialog-Optimized Large Language Model (LLM)
This repository contains the complete implementation of a dialog-optimized Large Language Model (LLM) built from scratch using PyTorch. The project's goal was to engineer a sophisticated conversational AI, moving beyond generic text generation to create a model that excels at following specific, instruction-based dialog and maintaining contextual coherence.

üéØ Project Motivation
While large-scale models like GPT-3 are powerful, they are often generalized. The primary motivation for this project was to explore the end-to-end process of building a more specialized, smaller-scale LLM that could be fine-tuned for precise, instruction-based tasks. This involved a deep dive into the underlying Transformer architecture, data processing at scale, and advanced fine-tuning techniques to create a model optimized for realistic conversational scenarios.

‚ú® Key Features
Built from Scratch: The entire model was engineered from its fundamental components, implementing the core principles of the Transformer architecture without relying on pre-built high-level libraries.

Large-Scale Data Processing: Features a robust data pipeline to preprocess, clean, and tokenize a 5GB subset of the SlimPajama-627B dataset for pre-training.

Instruction Fine-Tuning: The pre-trained model was fine-tuned on the Alpaca dataset, which contains instruction-response pairs, significantly enhancing its ability to follow specific user commands.

Task-Specific Adaptation: The model was further adapted for a text classification task (spam vs. not spam), demonstrating its ability to serve as a foundation model for various downstream applications.

Interactive API: A simple API was developed using FastAPI to allow for real-time, interactive testing and demonstration of the model's conversational capabilities.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The model is based on the powerful Transformer Architecture, first introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need". It utilizes a decoder-only structure, similar to GPT-2, where the self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input text. This enables it to capture complex contextual relationships and generate coherent, relevant responses for conversational tasks.<img width="3999" height="2653" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32f4ae60-c352-40fc-a4e3-73bd0b8cc8e0" />
